            <h3>Economy</h3>
            <h5>#3FY559</h5>
            <p>Kenya has kept the leading economic position in the East African region with the gross domestic product
                at 74.84 billion US dollars in 2017. The Kenyan economy mainly relies on agriculture, livestock keeping
                and tourism.[citation needed]

                Although only less than 20% of the land is suitable for cultivation, the agriculture industry still
                takes the dominant position in Kenya's economy. More than 75 percent of the population in Kenya makes a
                living from agriculture. However, an extensively distributed arid desert, unpredictable weather changes
                and outdated technology makes the agricultural sector quite erratic. In Kenya, 80% of the territory is
                classified into arid and semi-arid lands, where there is highly variable rainfall and frequent
                droughts.[citation needed] More than a quarter of the population and half of livestock live in these
                areas. In times of serious drought, the government has to spend an average of 50 dollars per family in
                relief supplies.

                There was a severe drought in Kenya that began in October 2016, due to low rainfall and extremely high
                temperatures. In April 2017, the drought escalated and was declared a national emergency by the Kenyan
                government.[7] The drought gave rise to a slump in production of the staple crop (maize) and more than 2
                million people were in need of food aid.[8]

                Droughts reduce crop and livestock production, cause great financial losses in agriculture and increase
                unemployment rates. Besides, decline in food production forces the government to provide food
                assistance, incurring extra expenditures in the national budget. All these situations trigger more
                severe poverty issues in Kenya.</p>
