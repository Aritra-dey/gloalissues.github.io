            <h3>Freedom Of Speech</h3>
            <h5>#RANA</h5>
            <p>Although the 1982 constitution guarantees freedom of speech,[22] the Chinese government often uses the
                "subversion of state power" and "protection of state secrets" clauses in their law system to imprison
                those who criticize the government.[23] Another crime used to jail critics such as Sun Dawu is "picking
                quarrels and provoking trouble".

                During the 2008 Summer Olympics, the government promised to issue permits authorizing people to protest
                in specifically designated "protest parks" in Beijing.[24] However, a majority of the applications were
                withdrawn, suspended, or vetoed,[25] and the police detained some of the people who applied.[26]

                References to certain controversial events and political movements, as well as access to web pages
                considered by the PRC authorities to be "dangerous" or "threatening to state security", are blocked on
                the internet in the PRC; and content disputed by or critical of PRC authorities is absent from many
                publications, and subject to the control of the CCP within mainland China.[27] Laws in the People's
                Republic of China forbid the advocacy of separation of any part of its claimed territory from mainland
                China, or public challenge to the CCP's domination of the government of China.[citation needed] An
                unsanctioned protest during the Olympics by seven foreign activists at the China Nationalities Museum,
                protesting for a free Tibet and blocking the entrance, was cleared[28] and the protesters deported.[29]

                Foreign Internet search engines including Microsoft Bing, Yahoo!, and Google China have come under
                criticism for aiding these practices. Yahoo!, in particular, stated that it will not protect the privacy
                and confidentiality of its Chinese customers from the authorities.[30]

                In 2005, after Yahoo! China provided its personal emails and IP addresses to the Chinese government,
                reporter Shi Tao was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years for releasing an internal Communist Party
                document to an overseas Chinese democracy site.[31] Skype president Josh Silverman said it was "common
                knowledge" that TOM Online had "established procedures to...block instant messages containing certain
                words deemed offensive by the Chinese authorities".[32] In June 2020, the European Union demanded an
                immediate release of Yu Wensheng, who after two years in detention, was sentenced on charges of
                “inciting subversion of state power”, for writing an open letter demanding constitutional reforms.[33]

            <h3>Freedom of the use of Internet</h3>
            <h5>#HGH7T</h5>
            <p>More than sixty Internet regulations exist in mainland China and serve to monitor and control internet
                publication. These policies are implemented by provincial branches of state-owned Internet service
                providers, companies, and organizations.[68][69] The apparatus of the PRC's and/or CCP's Internet
                control is considered more extensive and more advanced than in any other country in the world. The
                Golden Shield includes the ability to monitor online chatting services and mail, identifying IPs and all
                of the person's previous communication, and then being able to lock in on the person's location—because
                a person will usually use the computer at home or at work – which enables the arrest to be carried
                out.[70] Amnesty International notes that China "has the largest recorded number of imprisoned
                journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world"[71] and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders stated in
                2010 and 2012 that "China is the world's biggest prison for netizens."[72][73]

                As an example of the censorship, in 2013, 24 years after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, online
                searches for the term 'Tiananmen Square' were still censored by Chinese authorities.[74] According to
                the Amnesty International report the controls on the Internet, mass media and academia were
                significantly strengthened. Repression of religious activities outside of direct state control
                increased.[75]</p>
