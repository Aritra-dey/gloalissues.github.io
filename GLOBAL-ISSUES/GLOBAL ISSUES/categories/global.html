            <h3>Climate Change</h3>
            <h5>#8H84TF</h5>
            <p>Climate Change is a concerning matter of today's world. The United States' one of the greatest concern is
                Climate Change. Global Warming is one
                of the major cause of Forceful Climate Change. Even though, the earth has certain changes to it's
                regional
                climate every millions of years, it is natural and is
                done with the convinency of the planet. But, Global Warming is heading to Forceful Climate Change.

                Human-induced climate change includes both global warming driven by emissions of greenhouse gases and
                the
                resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Though there have been previous periods of climatic
                change, since the mid-20th century humans have had an unprecedented impact on Earth's climate system and
                caused change on a global scale.[2]

                The largest driver of warming is the emission of gases that create a greenhouse effect, primarily carbon
                dioxide (CO
                2) and methane.[3] Fossil fuel burning (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy consumption is the main
                source of these emissions, with additional contributions from agriculture, deforestation, and the
                chemical
                reactions in certain manufacturing processes.[4] The human cause of climate change is not disputed by
                any
                scientific body of national or international standing.[5] Temperature rise is amplified by climate
                feedbacks, such as loss of sunlight-reflecting snow and ice cover, increased water vapour (a greenhouse
                gas
                itself), and changes to land and ocean carbon sinks.

                On land, where temperatures have risen about twice as fast as the global average, deserts are expanding
                and
                heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[6] Temperature rise is also amplified in the Arctic,
                where it has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[7] Warmer temperatures
                are
                increasing rates of evaporation, causing more intense storms and weather extremes.[8] Impacts on
                ecosystems
                include the relocation or extinction of many species as their environment changes, most immediately in
                coral
                reefs, mountains, and the Arctic.[9] Climate change threatens people with food insecurity, water
                scarcity,
                flooding, infectious diseases, extreme heat, economic losses, and displacement. These human impacts have
                led
                the World Health Organization to call climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st
                century.[10] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for
                centuries, including rising sea levels, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification.[11]


                Energy flows between space, the atmosphere, and Earth's surface. Rising greenhouse gas levels in the
                atmosphere are causing a net warming effect to act on Earth's climate system.[12]
                Many of these impacts are already felt at the current level of warming, which is about 1.2 °C (2.2
                °F).[13]
                The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected significant increases in these
                impacts as
                warming continues to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and beyond.[14] Additional warming increases the risk of triggering
                critical thresholds called tipping points.[15] Responding to these impacts involves both mitigation and
                adaptation.[16] Mitigation – limiting climate change – consists of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
                removing them from the atmosphere.[16] Methods to achieve this include the development and deployment of
                low-carbon energy sources such as wind and solar, a phase-out of coal, enhanced energy efficiency, and
                forest preservation. Adaptation consists of adjusting to actual or expected climate,[16] such as through
                improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops.
                Adaptation alone cannot avert the risk of "severe, widespread and irreversible" impacts.[17]

                Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2.0 °C (3.6 °F)"
                through mitigation efforts. However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still
                reach
                about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century.[18] Limiting warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) would require
                halving emissions by 2030 and achieving near-zero emissions by 2050

            <h3>Overpopulation</h3>
            <h5>#0F556C</h5>
            <p>Human overpopulation (or human population overshoot) is the concept of a human population becoming too
                large to be sustained by its environment in the long term. The idea is usually discussed in the context
                of world population, though it may also concern regions. Human population growth has increased in recent
                centuries due to medical advancements and improved agricultural productivity. Those concerned by this
                trend argue that it results in a level of resource consumption which exceeds the environment's carrying
                capacity, leading to population overshoot. The concept is often discussed in relation to other
                population concerns such as demographic push and depopulation, as well as in relation to resource
                depletion and the human impact on the environment.

                Discussion of overpopulation follow a similar line of inquiry as Malthusianism and its Malthusian
                catastrophe,[1][2] a hypothetical event where population exceeds agricultural capacity, causing famine
                or war over resources, resulting in poverty and depopulation.

                Recent discussion of overpopulation was popularized by Paul Ehrlich in his 1968 book The Population
                Bomb. Ehrlich described overpopulation as a function of overconsumption,[3] arguing that overpopulation
                should be defined by a population being unable to sustain itself without depleting non-renewable
                resources.[4][5][6] Modern proponents of the concept have suggested a link between overpopulation and
                human-caused environmental issues such as global warming and biodiversity loss. To mitigate this,
                population planning strategies have been advocated to establish what proponents consider a sustainable
                population.

                The concept of overpopulation is controversial. A 2015 article in Nature listed overpopulation as a
                pervasive science myth.[7] Demographic projections suggest that population growth will stabilise in the
                21st century, and many experts believe that global resources can meet this increased demand, suggesting
                a global overpopulation scenario is unlikely.[8][9] Critics highlight how attempts to blame
                environmental issues on overpopulation tend to oversimplify complex social or economic systems, or place
                blame on developing countries and poor populations—reinscribing colonial or racist
                assumptions.[2][10][11] For these reasons, critics of overpopulation suggest overconsumption be treated
                as an issue separate from population growth.[12]

                It has been suggested[by whom?] that overpopulation has substantially adversely impacted the environment
                of Earth starting at least as early as the 20th century.[51][verification needed] There are also
                economic consequences of environmental degradation caused by excess waste production and overconsumption
                in the form of ecosystem services attrition.[56] Some scientists suggest that the overall human impact
                on the environment during the Great Acceleration, particularly due to human population size and growth,
                economic growth, overconsumption, pollution, and proliferation of technology, has pushed the planet into
                a new geological epoch known as the Anthropocene.[57][58]

                However, even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems, it is
                not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving
                all environmental problems.[59]

                Biomass of mammals on Earth[60][61]

                Livestock, mostly cattle and pigs (60%)
                Humans (36%)
                Wild animals (4%)
                Some studies and commentary link population growth with climate change.[21][62][63][64] However, critics
                have pointed out population growth may have less influence on climate change than other factors.[65] The
                global consumption of meat is projected to rise by as much as 76% by 2050 as the global population
                increases, with this projected to have further environmental impacts such as biodiversity loss and
                increased greenhouse gas emissions.[66][67]

                Continued population growth and overconsumption have been posited as key drivers of biodiversity loss
                and the 6th (and ongoing) mass extinction,[68][69][70] with some researchers and environmentalists
                specifically suggesting this indicates a human overpopulation scenario.[71][72] Some prominent
                scientists and environmentalists, including Jared Diamond, E. O. Wilson, Jane Goodall[73] and David
                Attenborough[74] contend that population growth is devastating to biodiversity. Wilson for example, has
                expressed concern when Homo sapiens reached a population of six billion their biomass exceeded that of
                any other large land dwelling animal species that had ever existed by over 100 times.[75]

        <div class="article" id="water-scarcity">
            <h3>Water Scarcity</h3>
            <h5>#95UUIF</h5>
            <p>Water scarcity (closely related to water stress or water crisis) is the lack of fresh water resources to
                meet the standard water demand. Two types of water scarcity have been defined: physical or economic
                water scarcity. Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands,
                including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid areas (for example Central and West
                Asia, and North Africa) often suffer from physical water scarcity.[1] On the other hand, economic water
                scarcity is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers,
                aquifers, or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Much
                of Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by economic water scarcity.[2]: 11 

                The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between fresh water demand
                and availability.[3][4] At the global level and on an annual basis, enough freshwater is available to
                meet such demand, but spatial and temporal variations of water demand and availability are large,
                leading to physical water scarcity in several parts of the world during specific times of the year.[5]
                The main driving forces for the rising global demand for water are the increasing world population,
                improving living standards, changing consumption patterns (for example a dietary shift toward more
                animal products),[6] and expansion of irrigated agriculture.[7][8] Climate change (including droughts or
                floods), deforestation, increased water pollution and wasteful use of water can also cause insufficient
                water supply.[9] Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural hydrological variability, but varies
                even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity
                can be expected to intensify with most forms of economic development, but, if correctly identified, many
                of its causes can be predicted, avoided or mitigated.[10]

                Water scarcity assessments need to incorporate information on green water (soil moisture), water
                quality, environmental flow requirements, globalization, and virtual water trade.[6] There is a need for
                collaboration between hydrological, water quality, aquatic ecosystem science and social science
                communities in water scarcity assessment.[6] "Water stress" has been used as parameter to measure water
                scarcity, for example in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 6.[11] Two-thirds of the global
                population (4 billion people) live under conditions of severe water scarcity at least one month of the
                year.[5][12] Half a billion people in the world face severe water scarcity all year round.[5][6] Half of
                the world's largest cities experience water scarcity.[12]

                Options for reducing water scarcity include: supply and demand side management, cooperation between
                countries, water conservation (including prevention of water pollution), expanding sources of usable
                water (through wastewater reuse or desalination) and virtual water trade.</p>

        <div class="article" id="terrorism">
            <h3>Terrorism</h3>
            <h5>#9YRH87</h5>
            <p>Terrorism is, in its broadest sense, the unlawful use of intentional violence to achieve political
                aims.[1] The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the
                context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel).[2] The terms
                "terrorist" and "terrorism" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century[3] but
                became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the Northern
                Ireland conflict, the Basque conflict, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The increased use of
                suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United
                States.

                There are various different definitions of terrorism, with no universal agreement about it.[4][5]
                Terrorism is a charged term. It is often used with the connotation of something that is "morally wrong".
                Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups.[5][6][7][8][9]
                Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives. These
                include right-wing and left-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups,
                revolutionaries and ruling governments.[10] Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in
                many states.[11] When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states, it is not considered terrorism by the
                state conducting it, making legality a largely grey-area issue.[12] There is no consensus as to whether
                terrorism should be regarded as a war crime.[11][13]

                The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more
                than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and
                2014.[14]</p>

            <h3>Amazon Rainforest Still On Fire</h3>
            <h5>#4G7487</h5>
            <p>The Amazon rainforest had a severe forest fire in the year 2019. The Governments of the South-American
                Countries had taken huge steps to stop it. At that time, it was a trending topic getting viral globally.
                But now in 2021, when the Amazon is burning again, no one is talking about it.
                The Amazon Rainforest is considered to be the lungs of the Earth as it provides most of the oxygen to
                the mass population. If this forest continues burning, sooner the oxygen level would deplete and people
                may suffer from breathing problems like bronchitis and Asthma.

                Brazil covers most of the Amazon Rainforest, the biggest Rainforest of the World, and the whole world is
                seeking aid to stop this burning.
                It is now told, that the rainforest, releasing most O2, is now releasing much more CO2, that is fatal
                for the whole biosphere. It is emitting more CO2 than it absorbs.
                As stated by a Geographic Explorer and Conservationist, that in certain areas, the burning rate is so
                rapid, that in every minute, a part equivalent to 3 soccer fields are getting burned.

                Not only CO2, but also CO (Carbon Monoxide) is also released due to incomplete combustion taking place
                at a mass amount, which gas is fatal for mankind ; leads to severe health issue and even death may
                occur.

                This may also lead to Species Extinction, which is already discussed.It is specified that at least
                40,000 distinguished species are at risk.

            <h3>South Asian & African Hygiene</h3>
            <h5>#3RT638</h5>
            <p>Hygiene is a matter of concern in every area as this only can prevent causing or having diseases. Even
                the Central and West Asia are maintaining cleanliness but the SouthEast asia, specially India, Pakistan,
                Bangladesh suffer the most.

                The roads are not cleaned rather scattered with garbage. The ruminants gather over a certain small
                landfill on the roadside and this also leads to the death of them as most of the rubbish consists of
                plastics.
                This also hampers the beauty of the area and the hygiene too. Living in such mess, makes people
                unhygienic.

                As there are many slum areas, the areas eventually get messed up. And the people over there, also get
                sick due to such unhygienic surroundings. The Govt. has taken initiatives but that’s in a very low
                level.

                African Countries are having a low economy, we all know, but the countries are developing a lot. We all
                are aware of it’s unhygienic situation but we’re not aware about the progress made to it.

            <p>Since we are evolving, we are innovating new things for our own comfort instead of bothering about the
                comfort of the pre-designed world.

                It is officially reported that over 900 species have gone extinct which incorporates - 299 of molluscs,
                159 of birds, 85 of mammals, 80 of fishes, 35 of Amphibians, 30 reptiles and 11 of Crustaceans.

                It is reported that, 3,040 species of fishes, 2,390 of amphibians, 1,848 of insects, 1,481 of birds,
                1,449 of reptiles, 1,317 of mammals, 742 of crustaceans, 237 of corals, 203 of arachnids.
                Birds are having a high chance of getting extinct.

                There were 5 Mass Extinctions in the whole history ; that are as follows:-
            <ul>
                <li>End Ordovician - 444 million years ago </li>
                <li>Late Devonian - 360 million years ago </li>
                <li>End Permian - 250 million years ago </li>
                <li>End Triassic - 200 million years ago </li>
                <li>End Cretaceous - 65 million years ago (Killed Off the Dinosaurs) </li>
            </ul>

            <p> The extinction of insects also involves bees, and that may lead to the doom of everything. But why?
            -> To bear fruits, vegetables and new plants , the plants need to reproduce. As we all know, they reproduce
            with the aid of pollinating agents, by which cross-pollination takes place. One of the greatest pollinating
            agents are insects, specifically, bees. They are the most responsible pollinating agents, helping the flower
            to pollinate and fertilize and bear fruits, vegetables and even offspring.
            If bees get the victim of mass extinction or even extinction, cross-pollination won’t take place. Thus there
            would be no such agent who transfers the pollen grains in such a huge amount and eventually, the
            reproduction in plants will be rapidly reduced and effected.
            There would be no produce of new fruits, vegetables or plants and thus, the whole food chain will get
            disrupted as neither the carnivorous nor the omnivorous can survive without the producers i.e., the plants,
            and the whole humanity would face the end of everything.

            The Earth is made for all, every species has some significance role to play in this world, and if we destroy
            this chain, this would eventually be the cause of our end itself. </p>

            <h3>Global Warming</h3>
            <h5>#45H75</h5>
            <p>We all are aware of this along with Climate Change / Climate Crisis.
                Let’s not just again repeat the things rather discuss some solutions to it. <br> <br>
                
               1.  Pollution - It is told to be the most responsible thing for Global Warming. <br>
                We should release as little carbon dioxide as possible, as suddenly it’s not going to change but if we do it steadily, we can. We shall use electrical appliances instead. <br>
                The best time to plant a tree was 10 years back, but the second best time is today. This is a famous quote from a renowned book. We know, the Amazon is burning, so, are we not gonna get the maximum oxygen? We can, if we plant trees. Just we need to find a suitable place and water the plant in proper intervals, and we can preserve the Earth and continue our life. <br>
                Industries must filter out their residue after combustion, releasing out through the chimneys or ventilators.  <br> <br>
                
                
               2.  Climate Change / Crisis - Nature itself changes the climate after millions of years but if our own deeds are forcing nature to change, it’s gonna have a worse impact on us. <br>
                Increasing CO2 level and depletion of O3 layer is fatal for mankind and the whole biosphere. So, pollution must be stopped. <br>
                Increasing CO2, uplifts the temperature and the glaciers melt, resulting in the rising of MSL(Mean Sea Level) and coastal areas may get drowned after a few years. <br>
                Certain forest-fledged areas are getting barren due to the movement of monsoon winds and other issues.
                Preventing pollution is the best way ; the other thing that we can use is to save and plant more trees.  <br>
