            <h3>Amazon Rainforest Still On Fire</h3>
            <h5>#4G7487</h5>
            <p>The Amazon rainforest had a severe forest fire in the year 2019. The Governments of the South-American
                Countries had taken huge steps to stop it. At that time, it was a trending topic getting viral globally.
                But now in 2021, when the Amazon is burning again, no one is talking about it.
                The Amazon Rainforest is considered to be the lungs of the Earth as it provides most of the oxygen to
                the mass population. If this forest continues burning, sooner the oxygen level would deplete and people
                may suffer from breathing problems like bronchitis and Asthma.

                Brazil covers most of the Amazon Rainforest, the biggest Rainforest of the World, and the whole world is
                seeking aid to stop this burning.
                It is now told, that the rainforest, releasing most O2, is now releasing much more CO2, that is fatal
                for the whole biosphere. It is emitting more CO2 than it absorbs.
                As stated by a Geographic Explorer and Conservationist, that in certain areas, the burning rate is so
                rapid, that in every minute, a part equivalent to 3 soccer fields are getting burned.

                Not only CO2, but also CO (Carbon Monoxide) is also released due to incomplete combustion taking place
                at a mass amount, which gas is fatal for mankind ; leads to severe health issue and even death may
                occur.

                This may also lead to Species Extinction, which is already discussed.It is specified that at least
                40,000 distinguished species are at risk.
