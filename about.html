        <div class="p" id="about-me">
            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I, Aritra Dey, the founder and owner of this platform, is a student of a secondary school in Kolkata in
                India. Don’t think that your data is comprised vat a student’s website. You’re safe as we don’t have any
                Data Collection Process. <br>
                I do have a habit of creating random website designs and mechanisms, and one day, eventually I initiated
                the work of this platform.
                Besides my studies, I always keep this as my hobby and do these things but at a balanced level as
                Studies is my primary concern. <br<br>
                    I always want the users to be safe and secure in my sole website, so I took all the possible
                    measures to
                    ensure safety and encryption. To read about the Safety and Privacy Policy, visit the doc now!!
                    <br><br>
                    Now, kindly know about the platform because you must have a direct trust with me and my platform.

        <div class="p" id="about-us">
            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>In this modern era, we’re connected to the whole globe via the internet. Like earlier days too, problems
                in different parts of the world are there. But, even dwelling within such amenities, we or the platforms
                itself suppress or don’t promote content related to the problems worldwide which must be resolved for a
                better Earth. <br><br>
                Social Media like Facebook, Instagram, OpinionWorld and many more creates opportunities for people to
                share whatever they want. In such a huge network, Global Problems get avoided upon Entertainment
                Content. And there is no such an open and dedicated platform where people will share / know the problems
                of different countries along with solutions (if possible). <br><br>
                So, the people who have the capacity to help out people or who want to help people, can’t do much
                because they’re not aware of the problems worldwide.
                Global Issues is an open and free platform where we’ll try to cover almost every problem faced by people
                across the world. I’ll be super glad if among the audience, there’s even one person who wants or is
                capable of helping the people suffering from different problems. <br><br>
                Every country, be it the United States, has problems because A country isn’t a country without problems.
                This is the for the first time, when a fully dedicated platform will be there where Global Problems and
                Progress to it is discussed not only posted by the platform but also the sufferers or the people, this
                website is made for free, starting from Development to Deployment in Free Hosting and Free Domain ; but
                is a SSL Security Certified Website. <br> <br>
                “There is no such problem without a solution”
                The Website is along with the few documentations like Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines , Freedom of
                Speech and Expression, Govt. Criticizing Policies, T&Cs, etc.
                As this platform, will be an open platform, people can share opinions to the article, share the issues
                prevalent, amend an article – and all these actions should not be violating the basic Community
                Guidelines and will be supervised but this platform practices Freedom Of Speech, so under that act, one
                must share the things (can be Govt. Opposing or in favor but unbiased). <br> <br>
                “Global Issues is not only a platform but also a dream for many”
                - Aritra Dey (Saha) <br> <br>
                Thank You, I’ll be highly glad if this idea of mine has some value to contribute in this humanity and
                preservation of Earth. <br>

                (Note: We don’t use names of Renowned Companies to defame rather we have appreciated their work that
                they create opportunities for the people to share whatever the want it the way to be). <br>

                In this platform, as we focus on the uprising of the neglected sufferers, the issues shared can be
                Global or Local, but localisation is referred to be as small as a Province of a Country. </p>

            <p>This discusses all the points, this platform covers under the act of Liberty of Speech and Expression and
                must be abided while sharing any sharable thing.
                One must abide by these points:- <br> <br>

                You may disagree with a policy of the government or activities of an association and you’re free to
                criticize them. (Read Our Govt. Criticizing Policies).
                One may publicise his/her perspective or views through a pamphlet, magazine, newspaper or a digital
                media, etc. <br> <br>

                While exercising liberty of speech and expression, you cannot use this freedom as a tool to instigate
                violence against others. You cannot use it to incite people to rebel against the exercising government.
                Neither can you use it to defame others by false means and mean things that cause damage to a person’s
                reputation. <br>
                <br>

                You must not influence the General Public to stop supporting a development or emergency campaign runned
                by the Govt. You can promote but can’t abuse.
                Criticizing the Govt. reflects that you’re a responsible citizen and awaring the government about it’s
                actions and policies but misuse or abuse of this power is highly discouraged. <br> <br>

            <p>Must not use abusive or vulgar words for criticizing the Govt. <br>
                You can use polite words to criticize. <br>
                You can criticize but it must not be personal matters instead a social issue. You must not post any
                personal hostility or enmity. The issue must be at least as of a town or city and can vary till Global
                Level, by abiding rules of the UNO. <br>
                The Little Criticizing is permitted and must abide by Liberty of Speech. <br>
                We are not responsible for any illegal or offensive posts, we’ll simply delete the post. <br>
                You must criticize under the Constitution of your nation abiding the rules and regulations and laws and
                rights. <br>
                Criticizing must not be against any individual (politician) nor a party (ruling or opposition), but the
                Government only. <br>
                We’ll check the request and if we find too much criticizing sentences, we may not approve it. <br>
                While Criticizing, one may also think that too much of criticizing isn’t fair otherwise the article may
                seem biased and we want the possible unbiased reports and articles. <br>
                In a nutshell, criticizing must not lead to any rebellion or violence in any media. <br>

        <div class="p" id="why-r-we-not-dot-com">
            <h2>Why are we not .com?</h2>
            <p>I, Aritra Dey is a student of a Secondary School, you can read about me to know about me. So, for a
                student and that also of India isn’t possible to invest money on such a trial website. So, with my
                knowledge of HTML & CSS, I have created this website just for absolutely free, starting from Development
                to Deployment with Free Hosting and Free Domain. <br>
                But don’t worry, the platform on which the website is hosted, 000webhost, is owned by Hostinger and is a
                trustworthy platform to host websites for free. Seldom, Free things are also safe and secure. Moreover,
                we don’t collect any data rather than Google Forms that are encrypted with Google Safety.
                As .com, is a top-level domain, till this website succeeds, I’m not thinking of investing in it.
                If this website succeeds, that only you, the viewers can only do, I can make the domain extension to
                .com.
