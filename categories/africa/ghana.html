                <h5>#8YU0Y5</h5>
                <p>In Ghana, a recent adult, Kelvin, who ekes out his living by earning less than $300 a month through
                    his garage, built a car resembling a Lamborghini in look that can run on 300HP. He took 4 years to
                    build this car. At first, he analysed cars and it’s mechanism in showrooms and then arranged scraps
                    from junkyard to shape the car. The car is a diesel engine one, has doors, gear stick, brakes, horn
                    and even a radio. He became the first of his town to own and drive a car.

                    <br> <br>

                    Richard, an African man, loves to teach about computers. He was brought up in a poor town and lived
                    for 20 years without computers. After his education in IT, when he returned to his hometown, he
                    decided to teach his village the newer technology. But, the students couldn’t afford a computer at
                    that time. Hence, what Richard did is that he drew a MS Word Window, every part of it, and made his
                    pupils copy his work and understand the workings. After a few years, when he got popularized,
                    Microsoft donated laptops, chairs, tables and even school uniforms to Richard. Then, the children
                    could interact with computers and deal with the development of technology.
