            <h3>Gender inequality</h3>
            <h5>#59U9UT</h5>
            <p>Bangladesh is one of those counties of the world where the number of men exceeds the number of women.
                Ninety- percent of the population adheres to Islam.[3][4] Veiling remains a domain of contestation in
                regards to whether it serves as a vehicle of empowerment or discrimination.[5] While seen in Western
                discourse as restrictive of women's rights, some claim that burkas allow for better freedom of movement
                in Bangladesh.[6] Despite the changes that have come with the demand for women in the export industry,
                women are generally unseen outside the domestic sphere. This is especially true in rural Bangladesh.
                While labour force increase has accounted for higher percentages for females than males, terms of
                equality are measured in various areas beyond employment. Their status and position is also measured in
                terms of education, income, assets, health, and the role they play in the family and in society. These
                characteristics are representative of the amount of political power and social prestige a woman is
                accorded and thus the extent to which she can influence decision-making within the home and in the
                community.[4]</p>

            <h3>Illiteracy</h3>
            <h5>#54TOG7</h5>
            <p>In 2011, the population with at least a secondary education was 30.8% for women and 39.3% for men.[1] Due
                to poverty, literacy rates have remained low. In the span of 30 years (1970 to 2000), the female-male
                literacy ratio has more than doubled, from 0.30 to 0.61.[2] While levels remain low, there is a more
                rapid increase of educational attainment for women than men. Enrollment of girls are rising in schools
                and colleges. However, due to financial constraints and the lack of earning opportunities for educated
                women, the rationale in the Bangladesh family to educate a boy over a girl still persists. Other
                impediments to educational attainment for women include early marriage, cultural norms, and religious
                orthodoxy. Participation in technical disciplines (regarded as men's domain) in areas such as
                engineering and agriculture is unequal as well. The student population at technical universities is only
                9% female.[4]</p>
