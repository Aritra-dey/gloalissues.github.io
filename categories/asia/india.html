            <h3>Social Discrimination / Problems</h3>
            <h5>#598GYH</h5>
            <p>India has always been affected with discrimantion, be it be political, social or anything else. Till
                Date, Social Discrimnation takes place and Political Discriminations are entitled as Reservation.
                As India is a rural-dominant country, treating people depending upon their race, caste, gender,
                religion, class, income stature, birth, creed, etc.
                We’ll discuss about Reservation Policy later, let us now discuss about valuable points of Social
                indiscrimination.

                India is still a Messed Country due to it’s Garbage piled up almost everywhere except some renowned
                cities / landmarks. It is believed that only low-income and lower class people will clean the nation and
                its not the duty of the higher class or middle class to clean up the nation. If everybody starts keeping
                the country clean, maintaining proper measures, conditions of India can be progressed.

                Torture between Hindu and Muslim is the most common religion rival present in India. Both the religions
                don’t have a nice relation, and always the govt. Has to take care of such silly things, which the people
                can themselves resolve and thus, progress rate of country depletes.

                In some places, women are still looked down upon and are not being given the equality and respect they
                deserve and are kept as products and dependents.
                In India, marriage is also a discrimination that the male must be elder than the female ; but people
                have opposed it and it must be according to most of the Advanced-thinkers. Unlike other
                Developing-Countries, patriarchal akin Male domination is still being observed in almost everywhere in
                India and parts of Middle-East and South-Asia.

                Nowadays, Caste Discrimination isn’t much practised but the situation is still worse in India that we’ll
                discuss in Reservation.

        <div class="article" id="migration">
            <h3>Illegal Immigration</h3>
            <h5>#546948</h5>
            <p>The Government highly discourages the practice of illegal immigration and too has legal process of
                migration, but under the table, some illegal practices of migration takes place which the government
                condemns and opposes.<br> <br>

                One of the Largest Migration of the world, Indo-Pak Migration of 1947 reported 1 million official deaths
                and over 20 million were displaced and millions were killed and thousands were abused. <br>
                Currently, illegal migrants from Bangladesh has been a threat for India in terms of terrorism,
                contribution to overpopulation, etc. <br> <br>
                The Central Government enacted CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and NRC (National Register of Citizens)
                and is in action but few provincial governments oppose it and severe riots caused within the country in
                early 2020. This was to ensure proper and legal registration of citizens but the border-state, West
                Bengal Govt., highly opposed it initially.
                <br> <br>
                Illiteracy has a greater contribution in supporting such opposition, which will be
                discussed in the upcoming article. <br><br>



                In states like Assam, West Bengal, Tripura, Arunachal, Punjab - there is not only a high chance but also
                migration is practised. The government has witnessed that if it doesn’t enacts CAA, NRC soon, the
                situation may get worse than ever. A person irrespective of religion, caste, gender, race will get a
                legal identity but the government discourages an illegal approach made by certain migrants. <br><br>

                If this isn’t stopped further, threats like - terrorism, religious riots, religious threats and
                violence, extreme over-population, scarcity of resources due to overpopulation, etc. may hamper India
                and it's Development.

            <h3>Reservation</h3>
            <h5>#O9GUT</h5>
            <p>The Govt. has put many efforts to reduce reservation, but, still it’s practice either under the table or
                publicly. <br>
                <br>
                Often, eligible students can’t get the suitable rank / job / platform for which they are made but the
                practice of Nepotism blocks the route of them and ineligible sons/daughters are put to those high level
                ranks. This such discrimination has also reported some cases of Suicide.
                <br> <br>
                The Govt. has created opportunities to the Depressed Classes of the Govt., but unwillingly this act has
                also led to Discrimination.
                The Few cases had opened the eyes of the society that this type of thing may also happen in India.
                <br>
                Again, in certain cases, the eligible performers get neglected as they belong from a middle-class or
                initially benefited class or caste, but an ineligible performer gets a higher rank respective of his/her
                initially looked down upon and depressed caste but irrespective of his/her scores or skills.
                <br>
                If a student scores 80% and has the skills and talents as per the scores gets neglected as he/she
                belonged from an initially benefited class instead a student scoring 50% or more and doesn’t have such
                talents as per the scores, get a higher rank or the sole chance respective of his caste background and
                emotions prevalent.
                In modern world, the scenario is or may get totally vice-versa, which shouldn’t be.
                <br><br>
                Certain cases have been noticed, that the progeny of a politician/ judge / lawyer / police / army /
                authority gets more chances to get into the same profession, which is not at all a bad practice ; but it
                gets worse when the progenies are ineligible for the profession and an eligible person doesn’t get the
                chance irrespective of his/her work, skill, talent, score, resume or anything.
                <br>
                Reservation must not be such a practice that blocks most of the opportunities and vacancy isn’t there at
                all for some eligible employees. This article slightly highlights Corruption.

            <h3>Water Logging and Flooding</h3>
            <h5>#3T5984</h5>
            <p>Being surrounded by high Himalayan mountains at the north and INDIAN OCEAN, Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea at the south, east and west respectively, India receives heavy rainfall except in certain areas. Not only the coastal states but the landlocked states too suffer from flooding and water-logging. <br>

                A Few Years ago, there was a tragic flood between the mountains of Kedarnath, a Hindu Holy Place in Uttar Pradesh, a landlocked province of India. In recent times too, areas of UP are being flooded every year. Every year bridges, roads, rails communication get isolated from rural areas and cause severe illness due to lack of supply of food, water, medicine, etc.  Not only UP, but Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Meghalaya also suffer from this issue. At the South of WB and Odisha, every year, flooding takes place due to Cyclones. <br>
                
                Even in the cities like Kolkata and Bhubaneswar, water logging takes place. This water-logging has reported several deaths , even from Electric Shock. 
                
                The historic houses are built in such a way, that if the roads get elevated, water will drain to the houses, creating more problems, and if not, a whole area may get isolated. <br> <br>
                
                People suffer a lot, especially the poor and middle-class, due to water-logging even. Being settled at the bank of the Ganges, West and South Kolkata suffers more from water-logging. This has led to several diseases like Dengue, Malaria, Food-Poisoning and even death has occured. <br>
                
                If this is not stopped further, the situation may get worse. <br>
                But, now, the government has taken a few steps to prevent it ; like Elevation of Priority Roads, Proper Wiring of Electric Cables, evacuating people from houses prone to fire or that have been aged more than a century. 
                The people are looking forward with the government to seek some more progress.
                
                The Govt. has also planned to save the water received during heavy rainfall in places like Cherrapunjee, Meghalaya, World’s wettest place which receives the heaviest rainfall to prevent Water-Scarcity in the country.
