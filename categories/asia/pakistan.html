            <h3>Corruption</h3>
            <h5>#5HYJ85</h5>
            <p>The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 implemented in the Dominion of Pakistan was enacted to make
                effective provisions for the prevention of bribery and corruption of public servants, particularly in
                the bureaucratic administration. The autonomous Princely State of Bahawalpur adopted its own version of
                the act, namely the Bahawalpur Prevention of Corruption Act, 1950.

                In 1955, an accord was signed between Nawab Sadeq Mohammad Khan V and Lt Gen Ghulam Muhammad Malik which
                made the state of Bahawalpur a part of the province of West Pakistan. This geopolitical change meant
                that the original act needed amendments to include Bahawalpur and other regions which were originally
                left out of the act. Subsequently, in October 1958, an ordinance was passed to extend the act to the
                whole of the province of West Pakistan – this is known as the Prevention of Corruption Act (West
                Pakistan Extension) Ordinance, 1958. This ordinance extended the scope of the original to the districts
                of Karat, Kharan, Makran and Lasbela and also repealed the Bahawalpur Prevention of Corruption Act,
                1950.

                Corruption in Pakistan is widespread,[1] and extends to every sector from government to judiciary,
                police, health services and education.[2]

                The problems are long-standing, and despite ongoing calls for reform, and many attempts to improve the
                situation, there is little evidence of progress.[3][4] The current government of Pakistan
                Tehreek-e-Insaaf (Pakistan Justice Movement) led by cricketer turned politician Imran Khan vowed to
                uproot corruption from all sectors. However, there is little success in bringing accountability across
                the board.[5] The promise to build a welfare state on the principle of Riasat-e-Madina (state of Madina)
                has been enshrined by recent government but there is little success on practical grounds.[6]

            <h3>Unemployment</h3>
            <h5></h5>
            <p>The Periods of Stagflation,[1] also known as Stagflation in Pakistan or inflation and unemployment in
                Pakistan, are periods of economic stagflation in Pakistan's economic history, which has affected
                Pakistan's economic trajectory since its inception.[1][2]

                The first period of stagflation began in the 1970s after the secession of East Pakistan and the
                formation of Bangladesh following defeat at the hands of India at war in December 1971. Although the
                government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made an attempt to end this period, it was subsequently ended by the
                military government of Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. The end of Soviet engagement in Afghanistan and
                inctrasing U.S. aid to Pakistan facilitated a second period of stagflation in the 1990s. During this
                period, both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif attempted to tackle stagflation, with Nawaz Sharif first
                implementing economic liberalization and privatization. The second period was ended by Shaukat Aziz's
                government who implemented much tougher taxation, monetary and financial development policies in the
                2000s. After Aziz's reforms, the third period came about after the 2008 elections and widespread
                militancy in North-West Pakistan, in addition to the global financial crisis. Pakistan's leading
                economists and financial scholars are uncertain to the causes of stagflation, and many attribute this
                period to several factors including the state's role in war on terror, corruption, tough monetary
                policies and several other factors.

                Yousaf Raza Gillani, Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2008–2012, is posthumously held responsible for
                doing too little to improve the economic situation.[3] The leading financial critics points out that
                Gillani's government carried out no major economic reforms to encourage economic development and the few
                policy measures and reforms were either very modest or collapsed due to opposition from his party's
                leadership.[3]</p>
