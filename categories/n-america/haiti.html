            <h3>After-Effects of 2010 Earthquake</h3>
            <h5>#39TRI8</h5>
            <p>The U.S. Geological Survey recorded eight aftershocks in the two hours after the main earthquake, with
                magnitudes between 4.3 and 5.9.[43] Within the first nine hours, 32 aftershocks of magnitude 4.2 or
                greater were recorded, 12 of which measured magnitude 5.0 or greater; in addition, on 24 January, the US
                Geological Survey reported that there had been 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater since the main
                quake.[43]

                On 20 January, at 06:03 local time (11:03 UTC), the strongest aftershock since the earthquake,[44]
                measuring magnitude 5.9 Mw, struck Haiti.[45] USGS reported its epicenter was about 56 km (35 mi) WSW of
                Port-au-Prince,[43] which would place it almost exactly under the coastal town of Petit-Goâve. A UN
                representative reported that the aftershock collapsed seven buildings in the town.[46] According to
                staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had reached Petit-Goâve for the first time
                the day before the aftershock, the town was estimated to have lost 15% of its buildings, and was
                suffering the same shortages of supplies and medical care as the capital.[47] Workers from the charity
                Save the Children reported hearing "already weakened structures collapsing" in Port-au-Prince,[44] but
                most sources reported no further significant damage to infrastructure in the city. Further casualties
                are thought to have been minimal since people had been sleeping in the open.[46] There are concerns that
                the main earthquake could be the beginning of a new long-term sequence: "the whole region is fearful";
                historical accounts, although not precise, suggest that there has been a sequence of quakes progressing
                westwards along the fault, starting with an earthquake in the Dominican Republic in 1751.[48]

                Tsunami
                The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning immediately after the initial quake,[49] but
                quickly cancelled it.[50] Nearly two weeks later it was reported that the beach of the small fishing
                town of Petit Paradis was hit by a localised tsunami shortly after the earthquake, probably as a result
                of an underwater landslide, and this was later confirmed by researchers.[4] At least three people were
                swept out to sea by the wave and were reported dead. Witnesses told reporters that the sea first
                retreated and a "very big wave" followed rapidly, crashing ashore and sweeping boats and debris into the
                ocean.[51] The tsunami reached heights up to 3 m (9.8 ft).[52]</p>

            <h3>Corruption & Poverty</h3>
            <h5>#97HJFG</h5>
            <p>In 2014, Haiti ranked as the fifteenth most corrupt country in the world by Transparency International's
                Corruption Perception Index with a CPI score of 19, compared to the United States' score of 74.[3] The
                Corruption Perceptions Index measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption worldwide. No
                country achieves a perfect score, and more than two-thirds score below 50 on a scale from 0 (very
                corrupt) to 100 (very little corruption).

                Studies conducted by Transparency International show a strong correlation between corruption and
                poverty. Corruption can affect several sectors of a nation causing problems in the social, political,
                and economic spheres. Widespread corruption can lead to factors that inhibit national succession such
                as: lower economic growth rates, a biased tax system, a wide disparity between the rich and the poor,
                the lackluster implementation of social programs, lower welfare spending, and unequal access to
                education.[4]

                Although Haiti has a high economic growth rate for the region, several social programs, and decreasing
                educational cost, studies have shown that international donors have been slow to assist Haiti, mainly
                due to perceived widespread corruption and structural problems present in the country.[5]

                The United Nations estimates a total of US$13.34 billion[6] has been earmarked for the 2010 Haiti
                earthquake that inflicted $7.8 billion in damages,[7] however, two years after the incident, less than
                half of that amount had been allocated. This is due in a large part to the perceived corruption of the
                Haitian government, and yet less than 5% of Humanitarian aid was channeled through it. According to the
                UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, as of March 2012, Humanitarian funding committed or disbursed
                by bilateral and multilateral donors in 2010 and 2011, only 1% has been pledged to the Haitian
                Government[8][9]

                The impacts of structural violence are far reaching. They affect individuals, and overall social
                outcomes.[1] Poverty is one of the biggest by-products of structural violence, as structural violence
                inhibits individuals and communities from achieving basic human rights. These basic rights include
                access to healthcare and education. As identified by the 2012 World Development Report, health and
                education are two key human capital endowments that can influence an individual's ability to reach his
                or her full potential in society.[22] Due to the inability to receive proper education and maintain good
                health, individuals impacted by structural violence often are less well-positioned to attain better
                socio-economic opportunities or to be upwardly mobile. In 2012, Haiti was the poorest nation in the
                Western Hemisphere, with approximately 58.5% of its population lived below the nation's poverty line.[2]
                The Gini coefficient for Haiti was 59.2 in 2001, making it the 7th highest nation in terms of its degree
                of inequality in the distribution of family income.[23]

            <h3>Illiteracy</h3>
            <h5>#58HGRF</h5>
            <p>Structural violence impacts one's ability to receive education.[1] Haiti's literacy rate is about 60.7%,
                below the 90% average literacy rate for Latin American and other Caribbean countries.[3] Due to the
                oppressive political and economic structures that are plaguing the nation, the educational sector in
                Haiti has limited financial support. The quality of education is low due to the lack of organization,
                expertise, and resources. There is a shortage of school supplies and qualified teachers. This problem is
                more prevalent in rural areas. Schools may use either outdated curricula or a partially implemented
                framework from the 1997 National Plan of Education and Training (NPET) curriculum.[24] Due to the
                state's lack of institutional strength and capacity to provide basic education to the general Haitian
                population, the education sector is now predominantly privatized.[25] A 2006 World Bank Study on the
                private education in Haiti found that 92% of all Haitian schools are privately owned, tuition-based
                institutions.[26] Due to Haiti's widespread economic hardship, the majority of the nation's population
                is unable to meet the cost of education. 88% of children aged 6 to 12 are enrolled in school, and less
                than one-third of those enrolled reach fifth grade.[24] Close to 60% of children drop out of school
                before receiving their primary education certificate.[27] The 2006 World Bank report notes that "the
                high dropout rate is generally not reflective of a Haitian disregard for or disinterest in education;
                rather, it is an unfortunate consequence of limited family resources".[28] In the poorest 20% of
                households in Haiti, school fees can represent up to 25% of a family's annual household income per
                child.[26] Of those who were able to progress to secondary education, 75% go to private schools.[29]
                Students who complete secondary schooling were not automatically eligible to enroll in a
                university.[clarification needed][27] This is because approximately 90% of the higher education system
                consists of private universities with high tuition fees, making it unaffordable to the general
                population.[25][30] While the average GDP per capita in Haiti is $673, tuition fees can exceed more than
                $2000 a year for Haitian private universities. There is also a lack of enrollment space among public
                Haitian universities, which comprise 5% of all institutions of higher learning.[27]</p>
