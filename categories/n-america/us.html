            <h3>Immigration</h3> <h5>#1J85HH</h5>
            <p>Immigration to the United States is the international movement of non-United States nationals to reside
                permanently in the country.[1] Immigration has been a major source of population growth and cultural
                change throughout much of the United States. history. All Americans, except for Native Americans, can
                trace their ancestry to immigrants from other nations around the world.

                In absolute numbers, the United States has a larger immigrant population than any other country, with 47
                million immigrants as of 2015.[2] This represents 19.1% of the 244 million international migrants
                worldwide, and 14.4% of the United States population. Some other countries have larger proportions of
                immigrants, such as Australia with 30%[3] and Canada with 21.9%.[4]

                According to the 2016 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, the United States admitted a total of 1.18
                million legal immigrants (618k new arrivals, 565k status adjustments) in 2016.[5] Of these, 48% were the
                immediate relatives of United States citizens, 20% were family-sponsored, 13% were refugees or asylum
                seekers, 12% were employment-based preferences, 4.2% were part of the Diversity Immigrant Visa program,
                1.4% were victims of a crime (U1) or their family members were (U2 to U5),[6] and 1.0% who were granted
                the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) for Iraqis and Afghans employed by the United States Government.[5] The
                remaining 0.4% included small numbers from several other categories, including 0.2% who were granted
                suspension of deportation as an immediate relative of a citizen (Z13);[7] persons admitted under the
                Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act; children born after the issuance of a parent's visa; and
                certain parolees from the former Soviet Union, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who were denied refugee
                status.[5]

                The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding such issues
                as maintaining ethnic homogeneity, workers for employers versus jobs for non-immigrants, settlement
                patterns, impact on upward social mobility, crime, and voting behavior.

                Between 1921 and 1965, policies such as the national origins formula limited immigration and
                naturalization opportunities for people from areas outside Western Europe. Exclusion laws enacted as
                early as the 1880s generally prohibited or severely restricted immigration from Asia, and quota laws
                enacted in the 1920s curtailed Eastern European immigration. The civil rights movement led to the
                replacement[8] of these ethnic quotas with per-country limits for family-sponsored and employment-based
                preference visas.[9] Since then, the number of first-generation immigrants living in the United States
                has quadrupled.[10][11]

                Research suggests that immigration to the United States is beneficial to the United States economy. With
                few exceptions, the evidence suggests that on average, immigration has positive economic effects on the
                native population, but it is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled
                natives. Studies also show that immigrants have lower crime rates than natives in the United
                States.[12][13][14]</p>

            <h3>Racial Discrimination / Racism</h3> <h5>#9GJ49H</h5>
            <p>Racism in the United States comprises negative attitudes and views on race or ethnicity which are related
                to each other, are held by various people and groups in the United States and have been reflected in
                discriminatory laws, practices and actions at various times in the history of the United States
                (including violence) against racial or ethnic groups. Throughout American history, white Americans have
                generally enjoyed legally or socially sanctioned privileges and rights which have been denied to members
                of various ethnic or minority groups at various times. European Americans, particularly affluent white
                Anglo-Saxon Protestants, are said to have enjoyed advantages in matters of education, immigration,
                voting rights, citizenship, land acquisition, and criminal procedure.

                Racism against various ethnic or minority groups has existed in the United States since the colonial
                era. African Americans in particular have faced restrictions on their political, social, and economic
                freedoms throughout much of United States history. Native Americans have suffered genocide, forced
                removals, and massacres, and they continue to face discrimination. Non-Protestant immigrants from
                Europe, particularly Jews, Poles, Italians, and the Irish were often subjected to xenophobic exclusion
                and other forms of ethnicity-based discrimination. In addition, Hispanics, Middle Eastern and Asian
                Americans along with Pacific Islanders have also been the victims of discrimination.

                Racism in the U.S. has manifested itself in a variety of ways, including genocide, slavery, segregation,
                Native American reservations and boarding schools, racist immigration and naturalization laws, and
                internment camps.[a] Formal racial discrimination was largely banned by the mid-20th century and over
                time, coming to be perceived as being socially and morally unacceptable. Racial politics remains a major
                phenomenon, and racism continues to be reflected in socioeconomic inequality.[1][b] In recent years
                research has uncovered extensive evidence of racial discrimination in various sectors of modern U.S.
                society, including the criminal justice system, business, the economy, housing, health care, the media,
                and politics. In the view of the United Nations and the U.S. Human Rights Network, "discrimination in
                the United States permeates all aspects of life and extends to all communities of color."[3]</p>

            <h3>Climate Change in the US</h3> <h5>#56A7CB</h5>
            <p>The climate of the United States is changing, in ways that are widespread and varied, because of the
                country's greenhouse gas emissions.[2][3] From 2011 to 2020, the United States experienced its hottest
                decade on record.[4] Different regions experience widely different climatic changes. Changes in climate
                in the regions of the United States appear significant.[3] For example, drought conditions appear to be
                worsening in the southwest while improving in the northeast.[5] Generally, states that emit more carbon
                dioxide per person and block climate action, are suffering more.[6][7] Some research has warned against
                possible problems due to American climate changes such as the spread of invasive species and
                possibilities of floods as well as of droughts.[8][9] Climate change is seen as a national security
                threat to the United States.[10]

                US greenhouse gas emissions per person are among the largest in the world.[11] As of April 2019, 69% of
                Americans think that climate change is happening and 55% think that it is mostly human caused.[12] In
                2015, The New York Times and several other sources revealed that oil companies knew that burning oil and
                gas could cause global warming since the 1970s but, nonetheless, funded deniers for years.[13][14] 2016
                was a historic year for billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in U.S.[15] In April 2021 the
                United States set itself a target of reducing GHG emissions by 50% - 52% by 2030.[16]</p>
